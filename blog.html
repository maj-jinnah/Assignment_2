                        <strong>Var</strong> - Variables declared with var are
                        function-scoped. But if a variable is declared outside
                        of any function, it becomes a global variable. Variables
                        declared with var are hoisted up to the top of their
                        scope during the compilation phase. Also, it can be
                        reassigned and re-declared.<br />
                        <strong>Let</strong> - Variables declared with let are
                        block-scoped. It means it is only visible within the
                        block where they are defined. Unlike var, let is not
                        hoisted. It can be re-assigned but not re-declared.<br />
                        <strong>Const</strong> - Variables declared with const
                        also have block scope. Const has to be assigned value
                        before its use and once a value is assigned to a const
                        variable, it cannot be reassigned or er declared. Const
                        variables are not hoisted up.

                        REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which
                        is an architectural style used for designing networked
                        applications. On the other hand, API stands for
                        Application Programming Interface, which is a set of
                        rules and conventions used for building and interacting
                        with web services that follow the principles of REST.
